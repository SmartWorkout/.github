## Welcome to SmartWorkout! ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Arkadiusz, a React Native developer with a passion for crafting mobile experiences. I've poured my enthusiasm and expertise into creating SmartWorkout, an intuitive and feature-rich application designed to elevate your fitness journey. Let's dive into what makes SmartWorkout your go-to gym companion!

## **Workout Tracker Panel**

At the heart of SmartWorkout lies the Workout Tracker, a user-friendly interface designed to effortlessly log and track your gym progress.

### Key Features:

1. **Repeat Workouts**: Easily replicate your past workouts with visible details like series, exercises, and rest intervals. It's like having a personal record of your gym history at your fingertips, enabling you to push forward based on previous results.
2. **Automatic Timer**: No more guessing or constantly looking at the clock! The timer automatically sets break times based on your last session, helping you maintain consistency and focus on your training.
3. **Supersets**: Combine multiple exercises into one intense set with seamless navigation and logging. This feature simplifies the process of tracking those challenging supersets.
4. **Current Stats Overview**: Stay informed with statistics of each series, including 1RM, volume, repetition differences, and more. It's all about understanding your performance and aiming higher.
5. **Customizable Workout Panel**: Tailor the workout panel to your preference. Hide or show past results, inter-set rest times, current stats, and even your RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion).
6. **Quick Exercise Actions**: Manage your exercises with ease. Access detailed descriptions, set breaks for all series, define goals, switch order, replace or add exercises, and even jot down notes or delete exercises.

## **Exercise Database**

A vast repository of exercises, complete with GIFs to demonstrate proper form. Whether you're looking for public or private exercises, the database is comprehensive and user-friendly.

### Features:

1. **Muscle Visualization**: Understand which muscle groups are being targeted with visual illustrations on a human muscle model.
2. **Customizable Units**: Log exercises in units that make sense to you, be it kilograms, pounds, or time for exercises like skipping rope.

## **Exercise Finder**

Navigate through exercises with ease, using filters for language, loading type (dumbbells, bodyweight, etc.), and muscle groups. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned gym-goer, finding the right exercise is just a tap away.

## **Training Templates (Routines)**

Create or use predefined training templates to streamline your workouts. With just a click, save your workout as a template, making future planning a breeze.

## **Training Summary**

Get a comprehensive overview after each session, with details on duration, number of exercises, series, volume, personal records, and more. Visual muscle engagement maps and the option to share your results keep you motivated and informed.

## **Training Plans**

Choose from a variety of training plans suited for different skill levels and goals. Each plan is designed to stimulate muscles differently, enhancing your strength or mass building journey.

## **Calculators**

Use the Barbell Calculator to know exactly how much weight to load for your desired lifts. The 1RM Calculator estimates the maximum weight you can lift for one repetition, based on your performance in multiple reps.

## **Analytics**

Visualize your muscle work over the last week or get a comprehensive monthly summary. It's all about tracking progress and making informed decisions about your next steps.

## **Body Measurements**

Keep track of body circumference measurements and weight, all while setting and tracking towards your fitness goals.
